lib:
====
- Currently commit/compensation actions do not post back failures. Implement
  the error handling module. 
- Blocking I/O aborts transaction and issues select() before transaction
  retries; if file descriptor is opened inside the transaction things get
  complicated
- Enhance statistics module to print description of each statistic when needed
- In the previous version of TxLib we pre-acquired sentinels in sorted order
  after a transaction restart. Current version doesn't support this. Ideally
  we would like to support both schemes and evaluate this design point.
- txc_sendmsg is not transactional. we didn't need it in our workloads.
  Implement it if it appears in any of our workloads.

 

tests:
======
- test self abort functionality when sentinel blocks; use hash functions to
  ensure that you always abort??? 
- test switch to irrevocable mode when need to fallback
- test self abort when doing a blocking I/O call
